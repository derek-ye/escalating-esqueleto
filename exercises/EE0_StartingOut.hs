Check out the "Getting Started" section in the README if you need to.

If you fill the typed hole above with `False`, you can check that the test suite

If you leave the typed hole around, you should see a compilation warning that
turns into an runtime error when the test tries to run.

Once the tests pass, move on to `src/EE01_Select.hs`
